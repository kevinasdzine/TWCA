TWCA Computer Coding Class

Goal
====

Introduce students to basic computer programming concepts. Where
individuals show aptitude and interest, provide additional resources to
allow them to explore areas of interest. If possible, allow students to
create their own program as a final project.

Format
======

Guided discovery of programming language.

The primary programming language will be Python. Where appropriate,
comparisons will be made with other programming languages:

-   JavaScript (programming language used in web browsers),
-   C\# / Java (popular server programming languages)
-   VBA (Microsoft Office macro language)
-   PHP (popular web server programming language)
-   Blockly (<http://think.cs.vt.edu/blockpy/>)
-   Codester (<https://www.codesters.com/>)

Outline
=======
